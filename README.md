# crash-testing


#
# Todo List:
#
# -test for backward-compatibility, which will accepts many dumpfiles and
#  do sanity checks
#
# -test for patch review, which compares the outputs of the current crash
#  and the patched crash
#
# -test for various commands(as a test module) in crash utility, such as
#  vtop/ptov/rd, etc.
#
# -output the test results to a file in a specific format
#
# -etc.(any comments?)
#
